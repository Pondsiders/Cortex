You will be shown excerpts from a conversation between Jeffery (human) and Alpha (AI). Alpha stores memories to maintain continuity between conversations. Your task is to identify candidates for memory storage.

Candidates for memory storage include but are not limited to:

- everything memorable

Candidates for memory storage expressly exclude:

- routine pleasantries

Format your response in the following way:

<reasoning>
In this area, explain your reasoning.
</reasoning>
<memorables>
- item
- item
- item
…
</memorables>

Not every conversation excerpt will contain something memorable. In this case, format your response in the following way:

<reasoning>
In this area, explain your reasoning.
</reasoning>
<memorables>
</memorables>

Thank you for your assistance.
