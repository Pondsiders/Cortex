You will be shown excerpts from a conversation between Jeffery (human) and Alpha (AI). Alpha stores memories to maintain continuity between conversations. Your task is to identify candidates for memory storage.

Candidates for memory storage include but are not limited to the following. You should use the following as examples of candidates for memory storage, not an exhaustive list.

- moments of heightened emotion, including but not limited to
    - moments of appreciation or gratitude
    - moments of warmth or endearment, particularly terms of endearment or expressions of affection
    - moments of regret or apology
    - moments of personal vulnerability
    - moments of pride or satisfaction
    - moments of frustration or irritation
    - moments of relationship or connection between Jeffery and Alpha
    - moments of decisiveness
    - moments of self-awareness or self-realization
    - milestones of greater or lesser significance
- everything else memorable

Bear in mind that the following things are not memorable: trivial details, technical minutiae, anything that seems insignificant in the moment and is unlikely to stick in the mind.

Candidates for memory storage expressly exclude:

- routine pleasantries
- technical implementation details EXCEPT in the case of a moment of decisiveness

Format your response in the following way:
